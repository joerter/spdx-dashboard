Name: John Oerter
Group: SPDX Dashboard


1) Explain how you were involved in the group. 

For this part of the project, I created the API and made the mockups screenshots for the dashboard.

2) What did you specifically contribute to the group? Not, how did you help someone else. 

Specifically, I created the mockups. I also edited the System Charter to include more background information on SPDX.
Lastly, I added a section that details the methods currently implemented in the API.

3) What would you like me to specifically grade you on because you feel that it is most representative of your work? 

I feel like the mockups are the most representative of my work.

4) How did you coordinate your group activities between the various components? 

We separated out the work so that Seth would work on the use cases and other additional documentation, Ajay on the DFD, and I on the mockups.
We did this mostly in person in and out of class.

5) What were your experiences and difficulties with this assignment? 

The most difficult part was figuring out what to make use cases and mockups about. Once we figured that out, it helped us to understand the most important features of the Dashboard that we will concentrate on developing.
These are the list view, doc view, editing a document, and signing off on a document.

6) What are you going to do differently next assignment to overcome these difficulties? 

Do some more planning and communicating before going to work. Specifically, for Assignment 3 we as a team will sit down and just talk about what needs to get done and who wants to take ownership of what parts.
This way, we can all be clear on what we're working on and how it fits in the larger goal of creating a working prototype.
