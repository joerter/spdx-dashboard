# SPDX Dashboard
## Analysis and Design

### System Charter and Description
This is where we will make our system charter.

### System Service Request
The following is a minimal requirement for the dev environment:
* An IDE that can edit and debug JavaScript code
* A server software that can host the database and any services, locally on the developers machine
* A database explorer to browse and edit database fields when required
* A debugging tool to check what values are being sent to the client from the server

### Stakeholders
Currently the stakeholders for this project are:
* Ajay Medury - Contributor
* John Oerter - Contributor
* Seth Hanson - Contributor
* Prof. Matt Germonprez - Guidance
* Liang Cao - Contributor/Guidance
* Jack Hanneman - Community (TI)
* Kate Stewart - Community (SPDX)
* Entire Class with various weights ( we will have the largest direct impact on the Airs and SPDX/NINKA groups)
* Others to be added...

### Communication Management Plan
The communication management will be handeled by the following methods:
* Team Communication - Primarily using phone calls, emails, text messages, and through GitHub. The communication will be handeled on a day by day basis and on days that we do not meet we will co-ordinate work via GitHub or email. The group will strive to communicate all time sensitive material to all relavent parties upon effective completion. Such includes but is not limited to: teams other than our own that are impacted by our performance and our collaborating with, the professor (Matt Germonprez), Liang and any other parties in close correlation to our work. The preceding is based only where applicable with no guarantees with regards to precise swiftness of communication. The Dashboard team will do every in their power to produce an environment that enables community betterment.
* Community Communication - The communication here will primarily be handeled by email, and potentially via voip tools such as Skype in the occasion that virtual meeting is required.

### Distribution System
The primary distribution system for assignments and any other information will be through GitHub, as it supports easy collaboration and file sharing mechanisms.
