## Analysis and Design

### System Charter and Description
This is where we will make our system charter.

### System Service Request
The following is a minimal requirement for the dev environment:
* An IDE that can edit and debug JavaScript code
* A server software that can host the database and any services, locally on the developers machine
* A database explorer to browse and edit database fields when required
* A debugging tool to check what values are being sent to the client from the server

### Stakeholders
Currently the stakeholders for this project are:
* Ajay Medury - Contributor
* John Oerter - Contributor
* Seth Hanson - Contributor
* Prof. Matt Germonprez - Reviewer?
* Liang Cao - Contributor?
* Others to be added...

### Communication Management Plan
The communication management will be handeled by the following methods:
* Team Communication - Primarily using phone calls, emails, text messages, and through GitHub. The communication will be handeled on a day by day basis and on days that we do not meet we will co-ordinate work via GitHub or email.
* Community Communication - The communication here will primarily be handeled by email, and potentially via viop tools such as skype in the occasion that virtual meeting is required.

### Distribution System
The primary distribution system for assignments and any other information will be through GitHub, as it supports easy collaboration and file sharing mechanisms.
