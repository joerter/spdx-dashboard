# SPDX Dashboard
## Analysis and Design

### System Charter and Description
The SPDX standard helps organizations track compliance with open source software licenses through the standardization of the way license information is shared. An SPDX document communicates the components, licenses, and copyrights associated with a particular software package. Although this standard creates a much easier avenue for organizations to comply with software licenses, it is still difficult to sift through a large amount of SPDX documents. The SPDX Dashboard addresses this issue by creating a common interface for the upload, retrieval, modification, and sharing of SPDX documents.

The following list describes the main functionality of the completed SPDX Dashboard:
* Listing of SPDX documents currently held in the database
* Detailed view of an SPDX document for a single file
* Detailed view of an SPDX document for a package
* Edit an SPDX document 

The SPDX Dashboard will communicate with the database through a RESTful web service.

### System Service Request
The following is a minimal requirement for the dev environment:
* An IDE that can edit and debug JavaScript code
* A server software that can host the database and any services, locally on the developers machine
* A database explorer to browse and edit database fields when required
* A debugging tool to check what values are being sent to the client from the server

### Stakeholders
Currently the stakeholders for this project are:
* Ajay Medury - Contributor
* John Oerter - Contributor
* Seth Hanson - Contributor
* Prof. Matt Germonprez - Guidance
* Liang Cao - Contributor/Guidance
* Jack Hanneman - Community (TI)
* Kate Stewart - Community (SPDX)
* Entire Class with various weights ( we will have the largest direct impact on the Airs and SPDX/NINKA groups)
* Others to be added...

### Communication Management Plan
The communication management will be handeled by the following methods:
* Team Communication - Primarily using phone calls, emails, text messages, and through GitHub. The communication will be handeled on a day by day basis and on days that we do not meet we will co-ordinate work via GitHub or email. The group will strive to communicate all time sensitive material to all relavent parties upon effective completion. Such includes but is not limited to: teams other than our own that are impacted by our performance and are collaborating with, the professor (Matt Germonprez), Liang and any other parties in close correlation to our work. The preceding is based only where applicable with no guarantees with regards to precise swiftness of communication. The Dashboard team will do everything in their power to produce an environment that enables community betterment.
* Community Communication - The communication here will primarily be handeled by email, and potentially via voip tools such as Skype in the occasion that virtual meeting is required.

### Distribution System
The primary distribution system for assignments and any other information will be through GitHub, as it supports easy collaboration and file sharing mechanisms.
