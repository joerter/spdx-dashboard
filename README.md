SPDX Dashboard

Overview

The SPDX standard assists organizations in tracking compliance with open source software licenses through the standardization of the method in which license information is shared. An SPDX document communicates the components, licenses, and copyrights associated with a particular software package. More information about SPDX can be found [here](http://spdx.org/about-spdx/what-is-spdx).

The SPDX open source tools is an effort by the University of Nebraska Omaha to support the SPDX community with openly developed tools for integrating SPDX with other efforts such as the FOSSology and Yocto projects. Visit the [SPDX Hub](http://spdxhub.ist.unomaha.edu/) for more information.

The SPDX Dashboard fits into this space by creating a common interface for the upload, retrieval, modification, and sharing of SPDX documents. It will consume SPDX documents created through the [FOSSology+Ninka](https://github.com/ryanv09/ninkology) and [Yocto](https://github.com/chaughawout/Poky/) projects and house an environment to display data from the [Product History Utility](https://github.com/zwmcfarland/ProductHistoryUtility).

The following list describes the main functionality of the completed SPDX Dashboard:
* Listing of SPDX documents currently held in the database.
* Detailed view of  SPDX information corresponding to a single file.
* In-depth view of an SPDX document corresponding to a package.
* Ability to edit an SPDX document at the file level.
* Signoff functionality.
* Integrate with Productization component.
* The SPDX Dashboard will communicate with the database through a RESTful web service.
